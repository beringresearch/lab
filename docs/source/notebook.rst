Working with Jupyter Notebooks
==============================

Lab makes it easy to work with Jupyter notebooks by creating a kernel directly from a lab project 

.. code-block:: bash

    lab notebook

Once the kernel is created, you can select it from any Jupyter session.

Lab also provides a `notebooks` directory to organise and maintain all notebooks associated with a Lab Project.
